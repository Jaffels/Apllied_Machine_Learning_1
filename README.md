# Apllied_Machine_Learning_1

This is the repository for the group project for Applied Machine Learning 1 at 
HSLU for Nhat Bui, Johan Ferreira and Thilo Holstein

The Data folder contains the the raw data in the csv file called 
drug_consumption.csv, the other 2 csv files cleaned.csv and model_data.csv is
where we saved our progress as we cleaned and prepared our dataset to avoid 
having to run the same code every time we worked on the project.

Our Rmd file called Drug Consumption.Rmd and pdf file called
Drug-Consumption.pdf is contained in the same folder as this
README.md file
