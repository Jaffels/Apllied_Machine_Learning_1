Nhat Bui, Johan Ferreira and Thilo Holstein

The Data folder contains the the raw data in the csv file called 
drug_consumption.csv, the other 2 csv files cleaned.csv and model_data.csv is
where we saved our progress as we cleaned and prepared our dataset to avoid 
having to run the same code every time we worked on the project.

Data folder also contains file Column_Description.txt that has a detailed 
explenation of all the columns in the raw data.

Our Rmd file called Drug Consumption.Rmd and pdf file called
Drug-Consumption.pdf is contained in the same directory as this
README.md file.
